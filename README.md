# fluxtty

vim, but for AI development.

A modal terminal workspace for developers running many concurrent AI agent sessions. Navigate panes with `hjkl`, send commands in Insert mode, chat with your workspace AI in AI mode — all without touching the mouse.

### macOS — first launch

macOS will block the app on first open because it is not notarized. Run this once after installing:

```bash
sudo xattr -cr /Applications/fluxtty.app
```

Then open normally from Finder or Spotlight.

### Build from source

#### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.77+
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Tauri v2 prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your platform (WebKit on Linux, Xcode CLI on macOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wangzewang/fluxtty
cd fluxtty
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

Built app is in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Development

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## Why

Modern AI-assisted development looks different from traditional coding. You are no longer just in one editor. You have multiple `claude` sessions running in parallel, each working on a different part of the codebase. You have dev servers, test runners, database shells, and CI watchers all running at once. Your job is to supervise them — review outputs, redirect agents, intervene when things go wrong, and dispatch new instructions.

The usual terminal workflow breaks down here. Alt-tabbing between windows is disorienting at scale. tmux panes get too small to be useful. The mouse is slow.

fluxtty applies vim's modal philosophy to this problem. You have a persistent view of all your terminals, and a modal input bar that knows the difference between "I want to type into a shell" (`i`), "I want to talk to my workspace AI" (`a`), and "I want to navigate" (Normal mode with `hjkl`). One window. Keyboard-first. Designed for the way AI development actually works.

## Features

### Waterfall layout

- Terminal rows stack vertically; each row fills the viewport height
- Horizontal splits (multiple panes) live within a row
- New terminals spawn immediately after the active row, not at the end
- Row heights recalculate on resize and sidebar toggle — always fills the screen

### Modal input bar

The input bar sits at the bottom of the screen, always visible. It has five modes:

| Mode | Indicator | What keystrokes do |
|---|---|---|
| **Normal** | `NORMAL` | Navigate panes (hjkl / arrows), open commands |
| **Insert** | `[pane-name] ❯` | Send to the active pane's shell |
| **AI** | `AI ❯` | Free-form chat with the Workspace AI |
| **Terminal** | `[pane-name] ❯` | Raw PTY input — for TUI apps (vim, htop, etc.) |
| **Pane Selector** | `/` | Fuzzy-search over all open panes |

**The vim analogy:**

| vim | fluxtty |
|---|---|
| Normal mode — navigate, don't type | Normal mode — navigate panes, run workspace commands |
| Insert mode — type into the buffer | Insert mode — type into the active shell |
| Command mode (`:`) — editor commands | AI mode — direct the Workspace AI |
| Visual mode — select text | Pane Selector — select which terminal to focus |

### Session identity

Every pane carries:
- **Name** — auto-derived from cwd on creation, updated when a significant command runs (see Auto-naming)
- **Group** — free-form string (e.g. `frontend`, `infra`), shown in the sidebar
- **Status** — `idle` / `running` / `error`, shown as a live dot in the header and sidebar
- **Note** — inline freeform annotation, opened with `m` and stored per-pane

### Auto-naming

Panes are named automatically and updated as you work. On creation the name comes from the current working directory. When you run a command, the name updates to reflect what's running — examples:

| Command | Name |
|---|---|
| `cd ~/projects/api` | `api` |
| `vim src/main.ts` | `main` |
| `npm run dev` | `dev` |
| `cargo test` | `cargo test` |
| `psql mydb` | `postgres` |
| `ssh user@prod` | `ssh: prod` |
| `claude` | `claude` |

Rules cover editors, AI agents, package managers (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun/cargo/gradle/mvn), databases, Docker/Kubernetes, and more. Once a user renames a pane manually, auto-naming stops for that pane.

### Workspace AI

Press `a` in Normal mode to enter AI mode. Type naturally; `Enter` submits to the Workspace AI. If `workspace_ai.model` is set, input is sent to an LLM; otherwise a built-in regex intent parser handles structured commands.

**Supported providers** (inferred from model name, or set explicitly via `workspace_ai.provider`):

| Model prefix | Provider |
|---|---|
| `claude-*` | Anthropic API |
| `gpt-*`, `o1-*`, `o3-*`, `o4-*` | OpenAI API |
| `gemini-*` | Google Gemini API |
| `ollama/*` | Ollama (local, default `http://localhost:11434`) |
| `claude-cli` | `claude -p` subprocess |
| `none` | Built-in regex parser only |

Built-in commands (available without a model):

```
run <cmd> in <session>
<cmd> in all sessions
run X then run Y in <session>
new [name] [in <group>]
rename <session> to <name>
close <session> | close idle
split
list | status
!agent <claude|codex|aider|none>
```

Multi-step and broadcast actions always show a plan preview and wait for `y` before executing.

### Agent detection

`AgentDetector` watches PTY output for signatures and classifies panes automatically:

| Agent | Detection signals |
|---|---|
| `claude` | Box-drawing UI (`╭─╮`), `✻ Welcome to Claude`, `esc to interrupt` |
| `codex` | `codex>` prompt, `[codex]` markers |
| `aider` | `aider>` prompt, version string |

When an agent is detected, the input bar shows that agent's native slash command completions (Tab to cycle). Detection clears when a plain shell prompt reappears. You can also set an agent manually with `!agent <type>`.

### Session sidebar

`Ctrl+B` opens a grouped session tree. Each entry shows the status dot, pane name, and agent badge. Clicking a pane scrolls the waterfall to it and makes it active.

### Settings

`Ctrl+,` opens a settings panel with five tabs:

- **General** — window padding, decorations, startup mode, input behaviour (`live_typing`)
- **Appearance** — color palette (live preview), font family/size/style, cursor style/blink
- **Terminal** — scrollback history, scroll multiplier, shell program and args
- **Keybindings** — table of all bindings, editable in-place, add/remove rows
- **AI** — provider, model, API key env var, base URL, confirmation behaviour

Changes are written to `~/.config/fluxtty/config.yaml` and applied live without restart.

## Contributing

Read `CLAUDE.md` before opening a pull request. It documents the core design decisions — the layout model, modal input system, and the scope of the Workspace AI — that should be understood before making significant changes.

## Inspiration

The waterfall layout idea — terminals stacking vertically, each filling the viewport as you scroll — was shamelessly stolen from [`infinite-scroll`](https://github.com/gaojude/infinite-scroll). I prefer the word "inspired."
